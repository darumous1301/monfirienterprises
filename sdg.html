                  <h2>Climate Action</h2>
                  <h4>by Alyzza Monique Aragon</h4>
                  <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges today. Its devastating effects, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events and sea-level rise, endanger ecosystems, economies and human lives. Climate change is already having an impact in many parts of the world and, without continued urgency, will get worse in coming decades. As an entity example, climate action qualifies reducing greenhouse gas emissions, progress to renewable energy sources, and keep longevity to the changing climate.
                    I chose SDG 13: Climate Action because of the impact climate change has on the environment, economies, and people. It is not just a scientific issue; it is a social, economic, and ethical issue that demands immediate attention. As a computer science student, I recognize the powerful role that technology can play in addressing climate change. From data analysis and modeling to developing apps and smart devices, technology has the potential to help individuals, organizations, and governments make informed decisions to combat climate change.      
                    Climate action is important to me because I believe in the power of collective responsibility to protect our planet. We are all stewards of the Earth, and it is crucial that we take proactive measures to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects. By leveraging technology, we can reduce carbon footprints, monitor environmental data, create solutions for renewable energy adoption, and raise awareness about the importance of sustainable living. Through projects that promote climate resilience, energy efficiency, and carbon reduction, I aim to use my programming skills to contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
                    Taking action on climate change is vital for the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. By harnessing the potential of technology, we can accelerate the transition to a sustainable world where environmental protection, social equity, and economic prosperity are balanced.</p>

                  <h2>Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
                  <h4>by Faith Gonzales</h4>
                  <p>Water and sanitation are fundamental to human health and well-being. The availability of safe drinking water and sanitation contributes to disease prevention, poverty reduction and overall sustainable development. Regardless of whether for drinking, cooking, or hygiene, water is essential for daily life and its quality has a direct impact on public health. These conditions can lead to diseases that are among the top causes of death in the world, especially when sanitation is poor and water becomes contaminated. Many people, especially in developing countries, face water scarcity, which is a serious issue. Clean water and sanitation are not just health issues but also affect the environment and economy, as poor water management can lead to the loss of resources and long-term damage to ecosystems.
                    I chose SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation because of its direct impact on global health and sustainability. Many communities around the world still donâ€™t have safe drinking water or proper sanitation, which causes serious health problems. As a computer science student, I am passionate about the role of technology in solving these critical problems. There are vast opportunities to use technology to monitor water quality, improve sanitation systems, and promote water conservation. Through smart devices, mobile apps, and data analysis, technology can help provide real-time information about water quality, educate communities about safe practices, and enable quicker responses to water-related issues
                    This SDG is important to me because I believe everyone should have access to clean and safe water, no matter where they live or how much money they have. I want to use technology to help make this possible, so that future generations can live in a healthier, more sustainable world. Working on projects that address water scarcity and pollution is a great way to use my skills in programming to make a difference.</p>

                  <h2>No Poverty</h2>
                  <h4>by Irish M. Banaag</h4>
                  <p>Poverty aren't simply the lack of money. In coding, it is a bunch of errors that is interconnected challenges. It is about lacking access to basic necessities, for instance foods, shelter, health care, education and even sometimes clean water. In short, it is about limited opportunity for employment, economic advancement, and social mobility. Therefore, it causes a systemic inequalities that create barriers to progress, sustain a cycle of disadvantage across generations. It's about the lack of power and voice, leaving individuals vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination. I've chosen this goal because it addresses the root causes of human suffering and injustice. Eradicating poverty isn't just about lessening immediate needs, it's about building a more just and neutral/fair world where everyone has the chance to reach their full potential. It requires a essentials shift in how we structure our societies, ensuring fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and power. My background in computer science provides me with tools to contribute to this effort. To be said, technology really can be force for positive change, and path that can be use as the key, or the solutions to address such multifaceted nature of poverty. It includes developing new technologies to improve access to information, education, healthcare, and financial services. It also involves creating platforms that connect individuals with opportunities, endorsing such community engagement, and empowering marginalized groups. Data statistics will reveal the patterns and insights, informing more effective policies and interventions. The SDG is profoundly personal on me due that I have faith in the inherent dignity and worth of every human being. I'd like to use my skills to build a future wherein everyone has the chance to thrive, and to be free from the constraints of poverty. Like they say, the technology is not just an equipment, or a tool. It has means to authorize individuals and communities that allows them to have their own destinies and well-off future. The contribution in this area is driven by a commitment to social justice and a beliefs that in the power of technology is to create significant, relevant rather in the long run.</p>
