            Project BinTech aims to develop a Smart Dustbin utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor (SG90), and soil moisture sensor to facilitate efficient waste segregation. The system detected waste using the ultrasonic sensor and distinguished between wet and dry waste with the soil moisture sensor. The servo motor mechanism then opened the appropriate compartment, ensuring proper segregation. This solution aimed to streamline waste management, reduce landfill usage, and promote environmental awareness. It was an affordable and reliable tool for waste management in residential and commercial sectors, aiding sustainable practices and promoting environmental responsibility. In the paper, a system was proposed that reduced the collection of wet waste and dry. The dry waste collected separately could be recycled efficiently, lessening the chances of air and soil pollution. A Smart Dustbin used sensors to sort wet and dry waste, composted organics and had separate compartments. It was energy-efficient, remotely monitored, and user-friendly, promoting sustainable waste management. This project aligned with sustainable goal number 12, which talked about responsible consumption and production.

            This research explores the effectiveness of using soot particles, derived from harmful vehicle emissions, as a source material in creating sustainable ink. The study aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and Goal 13 (Climate Action), by addressing air pollution and promoting innovative reuse of waste materials.
The research involves formulating ink samples with varying amounts of soot particles and evaluating parameters such as color, consistency, odor, and cost. Through experimental design, the study manipulates independent variables, measures dependent variables, and controls extraneous factors. Statistical tools, including Weighted Mean and independent tests, are applied to analyze the gathered data.
Findings indicate that the amount of soot significantly influences the ink's properties, with higher soot content impacting color and consistency. Comparisons between Vehi-Ink (the study's product) and commercial ink reveal notable differences, particularly in odor and cost. Vehi-Ink demonstrates potential as an eco-friendly alternative, effectively repurposing emissions into a valuable resource while contributing to sustainable production practices.
The study recommends further optimization of Vehi-Inkâ€™s formulation and long-term performance assessment. By transforming vehicular emissions into sustainable products, this research contributes to achieving a circular economy and mitigating environmental pollution, thus advancing global sustainability efforts.

        SOIL PREPARATION

Soil preparation is a fundamental process for readying soil for planting or seeding, involving activities such as tilling, loosening compacted soil, removing weeds, adding organic matter or fertilizers, and leveling the surface. These actions create optimal conditions for plant growth, crucial for healthy plant development and a successful harvest.  
This practice directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and Goal 15 (Life on Land). Proper soil preparation ensures sustainable agricultural practices that boost productivity, improve soil health, and enhance ecosystem services.  
One of the primary benefits of soil preparation is its role in improving soil structure. By breaking up compacted soil, roots can penetrate more easily, promoting better water infiltration and drainage. This ensures plants have adequate access to water, a critical factor in achieving sustainable agricultural outputs. Enhanced soil structure also contributes to maintaining healthy terrestrial ecosystems, aligning with SDG 15.  
Incorporating organic matter or fertilizers into the soil during preparation boosts nutrient availability, fostering resilient agricultural systems. This supports the realization of Goal 2 by ensuring a steady food supply for growing populations. Additionally, soil preparation suppresses weeds, reducing competition for resources like water, nutrients, and sunlight. This process promotes plant growth and minimizes reliance on chemical herbicides, contributing to environmentally friendly practices.  
Improved soil aeration, achieved through tilling or loosening, facilitates root respiration and nutrient uptake, creating a foundation for sustainable crop production. Furthermore, leveling the soil ensures uniform seed placement, germination, and plant growth, leading to higher yields and contributing to food security.  
By fostering sustainable agricultural practices, proper soil preparation plays a critical role in achieving global food security, conserving ecosystems, and supporting sustainable development.
